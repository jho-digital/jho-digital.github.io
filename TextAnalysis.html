    <h2>Reading Early Internet Texts through Text Encoding and Voyant</h2>
     write essay, use code blocks
      <p>Thesis: All the novels Little women, Pride and prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, The Great Gatsby, and The Enchanted April all share the theme of love, similar wording, character development, but also have differences in the same area.</p>

      <p>To begin, these novels widely express the theme of love, and how it connects to relationships between humans. In The Great Gatsby we have the non-exclusive relationship between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan that lies at the root of his wealth and freedom. This relates to Little Women’s Jo and Bhaer and their romantic interest because they both feel the pressure of societies, and through this they help each other change and realizes things they didn’t notice about themselves. Not only are there romantic relationships seen in these novels, but there is self-love which is seen The Enchanted April which in the formatting includes seen makes it very easy for the reader to know when the story line is progressing. Lastly, we have family relationships for example, sisterhood that are showcased as the root to finding your purpose and maintaining strong on it. Family and Friendship relationships are seen throughout all the novels.</p>

      <p>This theme of love throughout all the novels is easily seen progress through the formatting, but also on how often the word love comes up shows us the similar wording in all texts. As seen below
      <iframe style='width: 400px; height: 300px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=love&corpus=9ad5a9f29e881a6dbf9b32c7a41c2985'></iframe>
      <p>In this graph from Voyant Tools we can see the amount the time word love appears throughout all texts. My analysis on it is there is a lot of consistency in the graph from The Enchanted April to Sense and Sensibility where we don’t see anything pass 0.0008 until Little Women which hits a little higher than 0.0011 on the graph. Seeing the trends of the words was a very helpful way to see how often the words are seen. This helped me relate it back to certain quotes from the texts where they used the word love, or a word that had love within it and see if the context of love being used is the same. For example, while marking The Great Gatsby I marked every time the main characters of this text were spoken about, or speaking themselves. This allowed me to narrow my search and I found this quote from the text
      “I waited, and sure enough, in a
      moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as
      if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret
      society to which she and &lt;<person name="Tom Buchanan"&qt;Tom&lt;/</person> belonged.
      In this quote love is seen in the word lovely and is used to describe Daisy’s Buchanan face. This compares to this quote from Little Women “it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of
      lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only
      at the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and
      longing for the little girls at home.”
      In this case the love is used to describe the relationship between father and Daughter.</p>

       <p>Furthermore, another way to see the similarities of words seen was the Cirrus tool this not only shows the most seen words in the document chosen, but it also can show you the number of times of these words are seen in the other texts as well. The bigger the word the more times its seen.  This Is seen below.</p>
         <p>Heres an example of an embedded word cloud from Voyant.</p>
         <iframe style='width: 310px; height: 381px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?corpus=9ad5a9f29e881a6dbf9b32c7a41c2985'></iframe>
      <p>Now let’s talk about the similarities in character development and how the formatting of each text plays a part in how the reader may view the characters. The encoding process of my text some of which can be see above in the quote example really helped me see learn the formatting of the text and really analyze the character development in The Great Gatsby and be able to compare and contrast it to the other text. For example, in the markup I decided to mark up the places in The Great Gatsby the places being East Egg and West Egg I learned that East Egg village symbolizes old money, and West Egg symbolizes new money. this encoding allows me to understand the differences in the character for example in the text I encoded it states
I lived at <place type="village" name="West Egg">West Egg</place>, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though
this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little
sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the
egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge
places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. By this encoding of places we can see how living in the West Egg for Gatsby was a grand accomplishment and expensive because the places rented for thousands of dollars. Also, in this encoding Gatsby expresses the West Egg being a lonely place for him. “It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more
recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
"How do you get to <place type="village" name="West Egg">West Egg</place> village?” he asked helplessly.
I told him. And as I walked on, I was lonely no longer.”
In this quote he expresses how some days are lonely in a big space, and he wishes he has someone to share it with, and the excitement of the possibility. On the other hand, East Egg where Daisy and Tom Buchanan resign is known to be a more classic and elegant looking to bring out the history of it. In the text it is described as a “Georgian Colonial Mansion”. This shows the reader the mannerism Daisy has, and why it’s so hard for her to let her guard down because branching out, and having freedom is less common for East Egg.
<p>In conclusion, throughout this whole process of using Voyant Tools, and the encoding process I have been able to learn and analyze all these text on another level. I have gained a deeper understanding on how they all share the theme of love, the effects of similar wording, and the character development brought to light through the encoding.
