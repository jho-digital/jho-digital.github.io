<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The history of Eliza Bot goes back to January of 1966, and was created by Joseph Weizenbaum it was a natural language conversation program created so that there could be a human and computer interaction that mimics a Rogerian Psychotherapist session. Its hope was that people could get the experience of speaking with a psychiatrist without visiting one so the human could still feel understood and heard. </p>
<p>My Eliza Bot is acting as a best friend who is very sympathetic and willing to hear and give advice. The changes I created, starting with the Eliza initials I changed them to be more welcoming, and relatable, which would then allow for more open communication. I then changed the Eliza Finals to phrases that recognize the conversation had and leave off on a positive note to hopefully create future interactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I took the step and changed the name to Sunny which sounded lighter, approachable, and familiar, and I wanted this Eliza bot to resemble conversations Iâ€™ve had with my best friend, and make sure the responses show softness, and trust to the user. The other light changes I made throughout were all impactful, and made to make the user feel a connection, and feel heard. To also maintain the original Eliza Bot purpose, but just a modern twist. </p>
<p>
I would say my outcomes were successful. The Eliza bot for the most part portrays the act of a best friend, and when testing it out the responses made me feel heard, and the conversation always remained comfortable, and had comedy aspect to keep it light as well. </p>
